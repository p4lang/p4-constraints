# Utiliies

These libraries provide base functionalities that are used throughout the code
base.

The files in this directory are copied/adapted from the following repositories: 
* https://github.com/google/mediapipe
* https://github.com/google/iree
* https://github.com/google/nucleus

The files from these repositories are, respectively:

    Copyright 2019 The MediaPipe Authors
    Copyright 2018 Google LLC
    Copyright 2019 Google LLC

All code in this directory should eventually make it's way into the libraries
Abseil, Googletest, and Protocol Buffers; we should thus be able to gradually
shrink and eventually eliminate this directory.
