"""Bazel targets for end-to-end diff testing of p4_constraints library.

This file defines targets `run_p4check` and `diff_test`, which are intended to be
used in conjunction for "golden file testing" as follows:
```BUILD
    run_p4check(
        name = "main_p4check",
        src = "main.p4",
        deps = ["included_in_main.p4", "header.h"],  # allows for `#include`
        out = ["main.p4check.output"],
        table_entries = ["ipv4_table_entry_1.pb.txt, acl_table_entry_1.pb.txt"]
    )

    diff_test(
        name = "main_test",
        actual = ":main_p4check",
        expected = "main.expected.output"  # golden file
    )
```
The run_p4check target proceeds as follows:
  1. It compiles the .p4 source file to a p4info.proto text file using p4c.
  2. It invokes p4check on the .p4info file, checking the given `table_entries`.
  3. It records the output of p4check to the given `out` file.

The diff_test target then computes the diff of the `actual` output and the
`expected` output, either succeeding if the diff is empty or failing and
printing the nonempty diff otherwise. To auto-generate or update the expected
file, run:
```sh
    bazel run <diff test target> -- --update`
```
